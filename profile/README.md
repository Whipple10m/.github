# Whipple 10m

This site is dedicated to the preservation of code and documentation from the Whipple 10 meter gamma-ray telescope, which operated at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) from 1968 to 2008.

[Kildea et al., Astroparticle Physics, 28, 2, 182-195, (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927650507000746) provide the details of the Whipple 10m system (camera, telescope, DAQ) during the period from 1997-2006, after the so-called GRANITE upgrade program. The article is also [available from its author](https://kildealab.com/publication/elsevier13/elsevier13.pdf) (last downloaded 2024-11-19). The code here comes largely from this period of time.
